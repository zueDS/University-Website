                    Now, with the establishment of Braeburn Square and the development of community-facing resources like GoCreate,
                     we have even more attractions for the Wichita community at large.</p>

                    Beginning in 2012, a new mission and vision led to rapid expansion, with dozens of new buildings and
                     renovation projects, new housing and campus life initiatives, and public-private partnerships with a
                      growing list of businesses to support our firm commitment to applied learning, innovation, creativity and
