                    <p>The university is supportive in having the resources, network and different areas of specialities 
                        available to aid individual learning and achievements. I feel very supported when faced with academical 
                        challenges. There are social activities, clubs and facilities to support physical, social and mental wellbeing
                         as the university ensures the academic journey is successfully achieved.</p>

                    <p>The Students Union is a very modern and nice space. It is great to study in, relax in, and has a good range
                         of facilities - the Co Op is very convenient for grabbing odds and ends. The ICT shop is also very handy,
                          and has been extremely useful when I had some problems with my laptop. I also like how it is not a campus
                           uni as I feel more integrated in the city and it’s nice how it is spread out. Some buildings, such as the 
                           law building, could benefit from extra facilities such as a coffee machine or even a small cafe. Also some 
                           buildings are not very modern and could benefit from being updated slightly.</p>
